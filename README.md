### Overview of Contents and How to Reproduce:

This repository contains data, code, and output files associated with the paper. The files are organized into the following directories:

- **`data`**: Includes the complete dataset and the core dataset.
- **`script`**: Contains the R scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- **`output`**: Houses the generated outputs from the analysis, including figures, tables, and supplementary material

To replicate the results from the paper, follow these steps:

1. Download the entire repository.
2. Open the `Bombrini-Crossroads.Rproj` R project file.
3. Navigate to the `script` folder, where you will find the R scripts arranged in a numbered order for reproducibility.

For consistent results, the `renv` package (v. 1.0.3) was used, following the procedures outlined in its vignette. All analyses were performed using R 4.3.1 on Microsoft Windows 10.0.19045 (64-bit). Necessary packages are provided within the `renv` folder.
